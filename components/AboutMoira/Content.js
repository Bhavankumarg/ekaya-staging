          Moira, a serene village nestled in the verdant landscapes of Goa,
          holds a rich historical tapestry woven with Portuguese influence.
          Initially known as ‘Moiro’ during the colonial era, it stands as a
          testament to Goa’s cultural amalgamation. The village witnessed
          Portuguese colonization, reflected in its architecture, cuisine, and
          lifestyle. Over time, Moira has evolved into a tranquil haven,
          preserving its colonial charm while embracing modernity.
